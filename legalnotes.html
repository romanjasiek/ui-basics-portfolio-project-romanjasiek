<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>We have written this privacy policy (version 01.01.1970-121726947) to provide you with information in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as well as to explain what information we collect, how we use data and what choices you have as a visitor to this website.</p>


<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical. However, this version should describe the most important things as simply and clearly as possible. Moreover, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner whenever possible. We would also like to convey that we only collect and use information via this website if there is a corresponding legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible if you give very brief technical explanations, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. We hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you did not know yet.</p>

<p>Should you still have questions, we kindly ask you to follow the existing links to see further information on third-party websites, or to simply write us an email. You can find our contact information in our website’s imprint.</p>

<h3>Automatic Data Retention</h3>
<p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and stored, just as it happens on this website. This data should be collected as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e. everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.</p>

<p>Even while you are currently visiting our website, our web server – this is the computer this website is stored on, usually automatically retains data such as the below – for reasons such as operational security or for creating access statistics etc.</p>

<ul>
    <li>the full address (URL) of the accessed website (e. g. https://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html/)</li>
    <li>browser and browser version (e.g. Chrome 87)</li>
    <li>the operating system used (e.g. Windows 10)</li>
    <li>the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL) (z. B. https://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)</li>
    <li>the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from (e.g. COMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>
    <li>date and time</li>
    <li>in so-called web server log files.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an illustration:</p>

<embed src="./img/browser-und-webserver.svg" alt="An illustration that shows how data are transfered between the user and a webserver." width="90%">

<p>Generally, these files are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted. We do not pass these data to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data may be looked at by the authorities in case of illegal conduct.</p>

<p>In short: your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on servers), but we do not pass on your data!</p>

<h3>Storage of Personal Data</h3>
<p>Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address. These data do not get passed on to third parties.</p>

<p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>

<p>If you send us personal data via email – and thus not via this website – we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data. We recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.</p>

<h3>Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h3>
<p>You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG):</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li>
    <li>right to erasure (“right to be forgotten“) (article 17 GDPR)</li>
    <li>right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li>
    <li>right to notification – notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)</li>
    <li>right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)</li>
    <li>Right to object (article 21 GDPR)</li>
    <li>right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – (article 22 GDPR)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at <a href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/">https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a>.</p>

<h3>TLS encryption with https</h3>
<p>The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.
This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured – nobody can “listen in”.</p>

<p>We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=121726947">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>. With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.
You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol , which is situated in your browser’s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g. examplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.
If you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki” to find good links to further information.</p>
